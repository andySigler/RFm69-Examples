#Example Sketches for the RFm69 Tranceiver

This repo holds simplified examples for the RFm69 radio tranceiver, all using the Arduino library from [LowPowerLab](https://github.com/lowpowerlab/rfm69). These examples reveal the library's basic functionality with as little code as possible.

The RFm69 tranceivers are amazing for simple wireless application requiring longer range that bluetooth, low-power needs, and mesh-networking.
