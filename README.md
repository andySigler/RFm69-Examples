#Example Sketches for the RFm69 Tranceiver

The repo holds simplified examples for the RFm69 radio tranceiver, all using the wonderful Arduino library from [LowPowerLab](https://github.com/lowpowerlab/rfm69)

These examples strip away any application specific code, and simply reveal the libraries basic functionality. The RFm69 tranceivers are amazing for simple wireless application requiring longer range that bluetooth, low-power needs, and mesh-networking.
